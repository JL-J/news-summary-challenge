# News App Challenge #

This program uses the Guardian API to list news headlines.

## How to use ##
- Fork this repository
- A key for the Guardian API is required in order to use this program and can be requested from thier website.
- To start the server run `npm start` from the command line.
- Visit localhost:8080 in your web browser.

## My approach ##
This has been one of the most challenging projects I have worked on so far and consequently I was unable to implement most of the user stories. As I was not confident using APIs I prioritised getting this interaction working over testing, so consequently this project did not follow a TDD approach. Getting all the files talking to each other took a lot of time, as did rendering the headlines on the page from the API.

## User stories ##

```
As a busy politician
I can see all of today's headlines in one place
So I know what the big stories of the day are
```

## Extension ##
- This app currently only uses Guardian API and does not make use of the Aylien API. Incorporating this would be the next step in further developing this app.
- Clicking on a headline should load the article..
