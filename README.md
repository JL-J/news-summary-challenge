# News App Challenge #

## How to use ##
- Fork this repository
- To start the server run `npm start` from the command line

## My approach ##


## Challenges ##
This has been one of the most challenging projects I have worked on so far and consequently I was unable to implement most of the user stories. Getting all the files talking to each other took a lot of time, as did rendering the headlines on the page from the API.

## Extension ##
- This app currently only uses Guardian API and does not make use of the Aylien API. Incorporating this would be the next step in further developing this app.
